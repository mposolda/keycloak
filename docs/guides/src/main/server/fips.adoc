summary="How to configure Keycloak server for FIPS compliance"
includedOptions="">

The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2, (FIPS 140-2), is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. Keycloak supports to
run in FIPS 140-2 compliant mode. In this case, Keycloak will use only FIPS approved cryptography algorithms for it's functionality.

In order to run in FIPS 140-2, Keycloak should run on FIPS 140-2 enabled system. This usually assumes RHEL or Fedora where FIPS was enabled during installation.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/security_hardening/index#assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[RHEL documentation]
for the details. When system is in FIPS mode, it will automatically make sure that underlying OpenJDK is in FIPS mode as well and would use only
