# Configuration file just with the security properties, which are supposed to be overriden. The properties, which are not mentioned in this file,
# are inherited from the default java.security file bundled within the distribution.
#
# NOTE: Each property is specified 2 times. This is so the same file can be used on both FIPS based RHEL host (which uses "fips" prefixed properties by default)
# and the non-fips based (EG. when running the tests on GH actions)

#
# List of providers and their preference orders (see above). Used on the host without FIPS (EG. when running the tests on GH actions)
# NOTE: List is empty for now, so we test just with BCFIPS provider, which is registered programatically
